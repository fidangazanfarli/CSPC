# CSPC - Computer Science for Physics and Chemistry

My coursework repository. Each practical is under PW1/Lab A/.

## Setup

Create the environment for a given lab:
`conda env create -f PW1/Lab A/environment.yml`
`conda activate cspc`

## PW1 - Lab A: Reproducible Foundations

**What I built:**
- A radioactive decay simulation in Python using both explicit loops and vectorized NumPy operations, with unit tests in pytest and Git version control.

**Speed comparison (loop vs NumPy):**
- loop : 3.7854 s
- numpy : 0.0004 s
- speed-up: 9948.35 x faster

**Tests:** all passing? yes

**Conclusion:**
- Vectorized array operations with NumPy process large datasets drastically faster than standard Python loops.
- Setting up an isolated Conda environment and automated pytest unit tests ensures code reproducibility across different environments.
